Solved: 
**A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server**

I personally faced this issue when I wanted to connect my .NET Web Application to the Local Database.

If you are trying to connect your Visual Studio Project with Local Database and getting this error, this is right place for you.

NOTE: This may not be guaranteed solution, I have no idea if this solution exists open source but I tried to solved my error using following steps:

Prerequisites: If you have done any configuration in Visual Studio trying to solve this error, I request you to please uninstall the Visual Studio and reinstall it again.

Even after reinstall you will face same error so try below steps.
(But, It will make default configuration for Visual Studio).

After this, run the Following Commands in the Terminal.
(I personally have not faced any issue (some sort of side effects) after following the steps)


Run the following code in your command prompt:

1) Find the Local DB exists or not: (NOTE: Please copy your LocalDb version)
        sqllocaldb


2) Try to Start SQL Local DB
        sqllocaldb s

Note: If you get error to start (already running), try to stop it (using 3rd step)



3) Stops My Sql Local Db Instance
        sqllocaldb p


4) Now try to delete the instance (please mention your version below)
        Sqllocaldb delete (version_of_instance)
        E.g. sqllocaldb delete 15.0.4153.1


5) Now stop the instance using command (If error continue for next step)
        sqllocaldb p


6) Finally Delete localdb using
        Sqllocaldb delete


7) Create it again using
        Sqllocaldb create

8) Start the service again and it works
        sqllocaldb s



I hope after running following steps, you will be able to connect visual studio projects with your local db.

Again this is not guaranteed but it has helped many of my friends' and wish the same for you.
